# NEAT

## installation

**Install JAX**: 
Please first follow JAX's [installation instruction](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) with optional GPU/TPU backend support.
In case JAX is not set up, EvoJAX installation will still try pulling a CPU-only version of JAX.
Note that Colab runtimes come with JAX pre-installed.

Install EvoJAX:
```
# Install from PyPI.
pip install evojax
```
